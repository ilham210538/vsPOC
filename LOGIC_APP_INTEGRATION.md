# Logic App Integration Setup Guide

## üéØ Overview
This guide explains how to connect your existing Logic App approval workflow to the Calendar Agent, enabling automated approval processes for leave requests and meeting approvals.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
Calendar Agent ‚Üí Logic App ‚Üí Approval Email ‚Üí Manager Decision ‚Üí Callback ‚Üí Agent Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                            ‚Üì              ‚Üì
1. User Request  2. Send Email    3. Manager    4. Update     5. Notify User
   (Leave/Meet)     with Approve/   Clicks       Agent via     (Approved/
                    Reject Buttons  Button       Webhook       Rejected)
```

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Existing Logic App
‚úÖ You already have a Logic App named "ApprovalWorkflow" (or similar)
‚úÖ Your Logic App has the HTTP trigger: "When_an_HTTP_request_is_received"
‚úÖ Your Logic App expects this payload format:
```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": "approver@company.com",
    "subject": "Subject",
    "bodyText": "Plain text body"
  },
  "callbackUrl": "https://your-callback-endpoint"
}
```

### 2. Azure Resources
- Azure subscription with your Logic App
- Resource group containing the Logic App
- Proper permissions to manage Logic Apps

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Logic App Integration
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-azure-subscription-id
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=your-resource-group-name
LOGIC_APP_NAME=ApprovalWorkflow
LOGIC_APP_TRIGGER_NAME=When_an_HTTP_request_is_received

# Callback Configuration
CALLBACK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
CALLBACK_PORT=5000
```

### Step 2: Install Additional Dependencies

Update your requirements:
```bash
pip install azure-mgmt-logic flask
```

### Step 3: Get Your Logic App Details

1. Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí Your Logic App
2. Copy the **subscription ID** from the URL or Overview page
3. Copy the **resource group name** 
4. Note the **Logic App name** (should match your actual name)
5. In Logic App Designer, find your HTTP trigger and copy the **trigger name**

### Step 4: Update Logic App Callback (Important!)

Your Logic App needs to call back to the agent. Update the HTTP actions in your Logic App:

**For Approved Branch:**
```json
{
  "uri": "@triggerBody()?['callbackUrl']",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "selectedOption": "@{body('Send_approval_email')?['SelectedOption']}",
    "message": "@{outputs('Compose_-_Agent_Message_(Approved)')}"
  }
}
```

**For Rejected Branch:**
```json
{
  "uri": "@triggerBody()?['callbackUrl']",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "status": "REJECTED", 
    "selectedOption": "@{body('Send_approval_email')?['SelectedOption']}",
    "message": "@{outputs('Compose_-_Agent_Message_(Rejected)')}"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Testing the Integration

### Test 1: Start the Enhanced Agent
```bash
python src/interactive_chat.py
```

### Test 2: Request Leave Approval
```
User: I want to request leave from October 15 to October 17 for a family vacation
```

The agent should:
1. Check your current calendar for conflicts
2. Ask for your manager's email if not provided
3. Send the approval request to Logic App
4. Provide you with a tracking ID
5. Wait for the Logic App callback

### Test 3: Check Approval Status
```
User: What's the status of my leave request?
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Production Deployment

For production, replace the callback service with a proper web application:

1. **Deploy to Azure App Service:**
   - Upload the `approval_callback_service.py` as a Flask app
   - Update `CALLBACK_BASE_URL` to your App Service URL
   - Configure proper authentication and HTTPS

2. **Use Azure Function:**
   - Create an Azure Function to handle callbacks
   - Update Logic App to call the Function URL

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:** Add authentication to your callback endpoints
2. **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all callback URLs in production
3. **Validation:** Validate incoming callback payloads
4. **Secrets:** Use Azure Key Vault for sensitive configuration

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Logic App not registered:**
   ```
   Error: Logic App 'ApprovalWorkflow' not registered
   ```
   - Check subscription ID and resource group name
   - Verify Logic App exists and you have permissions
   - Check the trigger name matches exactly

2. **Callback not received:**
   ```
   Approval sent but no response received
   ```
   - Check if callback service is running (port 5000)
   - Verify callback URL is accessible from Logic App
   - Check Logic App run history for errors

3. **Permission errors:**
   ```
   Error: Insufficient privileges to complete the operation
   ```
   - Your Azure account needs Logic App Contributor role
   - Check if the Logic App is in the correct resource group

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Logic App Run History

1. Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí Your Logic App
2. Click "Overview" ‚Üí "Runs history"
3. Check recent runs for errors
4. Verify the payload received matches expected format

## üìù Example Workflows

### Leave Request Flow
```
1. User: "I need leave Dec 20-22 for holiday"
2. Agent: Checks calendar, finds meetings on Dec 21
3. Agent: "You have a client meeting on Dec 21. Proceed with leave request?"
4. User: "Yes, I'll reschedule the meeting"
5. Agent: "What's your manager's email?"
6. User: "manager@company.com"
7. Agent: Sends to Logic App ‚Üí Email sent ‚Üí Manager approves
8. Agent: "‚úÖ Your leave request has been approved!"
```

### Meeting Approval Flow
```
1. User: "Schedule exec meeting with CEO next Friday 2pm"
2. Agent: "This requires approval. Manager's email?"
3. User: "director@company.com" 
4. Agent: Sends approval request ‚Üí Email sent ‚Üí Director approves
5. Agent: "‚úÖ Meeting approved and created in calendar"
```

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Approval request volume
- Approval/rejection rates
- Response time from managers
- Failed callback attempts

### Azure Application Insights
Configure Application Insights to monitor:
- Logic App execution time
- Callback service performance
- Error rates and exceptions

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Test the basic integration** with your existing Logic App
2. **Customize approval email templates** in Logic App
3. **Add more approval types** (meeting rooms, equipment, etc.)
4. **Integrate with HR systems** for automatic leave balance updates
5. **Create approval dashboards** for managers
